This is a bioethics paper written for a Tufts Univeristy class in Molecular Biotechnology. There is really no reason you should be reading this paper.

Furthermore, I'll mention this is a really bad paper to plagerize. First, it's going to be submitted to turnitin, so it will almost certainly be found in even a trivial attempt to catch plagrisim. Second, there's a very clear link inidcating that I am the personal owner of this paper.
