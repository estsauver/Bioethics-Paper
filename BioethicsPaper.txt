In the status quo, pharmaceutical companies are using indiginous knowledge to great effect for pharmeceutical development with little renumeration for indiginous groups. Their is a large economic incentive to exploit the previous discoveries as nature has found many more solutions than organic chemists have. The value of the pharmaceuticals developed from indiginous knowledge has been estimated to be 43 Billion dollars, with further economic value coming from drastically accelerated pharmeceutical development in plant derivatives, estimated to be ~4X faster (Reid 2010, p. 80), with even small stakes in this large pie having substantial ramifications for communities. 
Ethical and legal issues in partitioning the revenues resulting from the knowledge of indiginous peoples involves a broad range of issues from the 


In particular, applying patent law to traditional knowledges is difficult as prior art docuemnted in the oral tradition is typically not considered, and the exact date of disclosure may be difficult to determine. (Newcity, 2009, p. 300).
In a further fashion the patents prior art may have only been previously described in the context of an oral tradition, which is typically not legally admissable as prior art (Newcity also, a couple pages later).
In some jurisdictions the Oral tradition, such as those modeled after the European Patent Commission's approach, the oral tradition is only considered valid if previously recorded or if a stenographic recording of the speech is available.




A confounding factor is the sovereign claim to posession of IP derived from the biodiversity of its country, many of which have specific legislation regulating the development of commercial products from the biological resources of the nation. For example, the South African Biodiversity Act requires a permit for any bioprospecting with agreeements to share revenue derived from any bioprospecting or for any biological material to be exported for the same reason. (Mueller 2011, p. 396).
